Over the last number of weeks I have been tearing down and performing research
into a device powered by an STM32F103x microcontroller. As this particular
device had RDP (Read-Out Protection) set to Level 1 it was not possible to dump
the firmware from the device. In line with this, any attempts to inspect the
contents of the flash via debugger would generate an immediate HF (Hard Fault).

While searching for potential workarounds to this particular challenge, I came
across a paper by Johannes Obermaier and Stefan Tatschner entitled ["Shedding
too much Light on a Microcontrollerâ€™s Firmware Protection"](https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/en/FirmwareProtection.html).
Although this paper covers a number of attacks on the STM32, one immediately
piqued my interest. This attack, under "3.3 Debug Interface Exploit" of the
paper linked to above, attempts to exploit a race condition between the SWD
debug interface and the enforcement of the readout protection. This allowed
the authors to extract the firmware from a read protected STM32F0 a word at
a time.

Now, I'm not able to do this attack, nor the paper, any justice here, so I
would recommend reading the full paper. It's a fantastic read.

From here I was left with a problem: I had no idea about any of the SWD inner
workings. All I knew was that it was exposed on the STM32F103x I was targeting,
it was a 'two wire' debug interface, and I could use OpenOCD to interrogate it.
This said, the author's of the paper above did release a 'canned exploit', but
where's the fun in running a canned exploit if you don't know how it works, eh?
:)

As a result of all of this, I have spent a great number of evenings pouring
over datasheets in order to better understand SWD, and build my own SWD
'client' implementation in Python. The intention being to both better
understand the protocol, and also provide an easily extensible set of modules
which may be used in further research. 

So, with all of this said...

This series of posts detail my 'down the rabbit hole' encounters with SWD,
how the protocol functions, notable caveats, and how to bend it to your will.

## SWD?

Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is an alternate 'debugging interface' to JTAG. This
interface can be used - with an appropriate debugger - to perform a number
of operations, which has been detailed below. It is very much worth noting that
this is by no means an exhaustive list.

  * Debug microprocessor cores (MCUs) attached to the system.
    * This includes display and modification of registers and memory.
  * Debug components that exist WITHIN a System On Chip (SoC).
    * Provides access to debug components with no directly exposed pins.
    * This assumes that the component is connected to a debug bus internally.
  * Access JTAG interfaces of devices attached to the system.
    * This requires an appropriate `JTAG-AP` Access Port (AP).

This post is written regarding SWD as it exists in ADI v5 (ARM Debug Interface),
per [ARM IHI 0031C](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf).

### Lines

Unlike JTAG, SWD only requires two lines for operation: `SWDIO` and `SWDCLK`.

  * `SWDIO` - I/O
    * This is driven by both the host AND the target, depending on dataflow.
    * When the host controls the line, bits are banged onto this wire on the
      falling edge of the clock.
    * When the target controls the line, bits are banged onto this wire on the
      rising edge of the clock.
  * `SWCLK` - Clock
    * Provides clocking of the debug interface.
    * This is driven by the host.

The comments related to the rising or falling edge of the clock may be better
explained by the following diagram:

![](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-Rise-Fall.png){: .center-image }

For context, let's assume that the host has just written a request packet
onto `SWDIO`. Let's also assume that the above 'capture' is taken after
this request has already been written, and control of `SWDIO` has been
transferred to the target. Now, don't worry too much about the terminology
yet, this will be covered later, just be aware that the host has REQUESTED
something of the target. 

In this case, the host would read a response of `0b0110` from the target.

Now, if the above scenario were inverted, and this capture was the target
reading a REQUEST from the host, the value on `SWDIO` would be read by the
target as `0b0100`.

### Bit Order

An important caveat to note when working with SWD - per section 4.2.4 of
[ARM IHI 0031C](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf):

> All data values in SWD operations are transferred LSB first.

As a result of this, data on the `SWDIO` line will appear to be 'backwards'
if read with a debugger which doesn't automatically flip the bit order. For
the accustomed, this simply means that the least significant bit (LSB) will
be placed on the wire FIRST, instead of last.

In order to better explain, consider the following example:

![](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-Bit-Order.png){: .center-image }

The last clock cycle is being 'ignored' here (hence the `X`), as in this
context it would be interpreted as a 'turn round' sequence by the host. This
will be covered later, but this is why we're only interpreting THREE bits
when there are four in the diagram! :)

In line with the above diagram, assuming that this was an SWD `ACK` packet
being written onto `SWDIO` by the target, a value of `0b001` would be read
by the host. If taken at face value, and as appears it appeared on the wire,
this response would indicate an SWD ACK `OK` (`0b001`) was being sent in
response to our most recent request. However...

**THIS IS NOT THE CASE, THE RESPONSE IS ACTUALLY AN SWD ACK `FAULT` (`0b100`).**

This is due to all data on the wire being represented in LSB order. In order
to flip - so that the most significant bit (MSB) is first - simply reverse the
order of the bits:

* `0b001` becomes `0b100`
* `0b100` becomes `0b001`
* ...et cetera

### `DP` vs `AP` vs `DAP`?!

Before we continue, it's important to clarify a few terms used heavily
throughout, namely port types:

  * **Debug Port (DP).**
    * The interface to which the debugger is physically connected.
    * Provides external access to the system.
  * **Access Port (AP).**
    * Exist within the system and are accessed externally via a Debug Port (DP).
    * Though there may be more, there WILL be at least one AP in given system.
    * The AP to interact with is specified via the `APSEL` field of the DP
      `SELECT` register.
  * **Debug Access Port (DAP).**
    * AP and DP.

The placement, and differences between these ports, may be better explained
by the following diagram:

![](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-System.png){: .center-image }

In the above diagram, `SWD` represents the `SWD` protocol being spoken over a
set of two wires.

### Packets

Data transfers in SWD are 'packet' based and successful requests will consist
of three components:

* 8-bits - Request Header.
  * Sent from the host to the target
* 3-bits - An Acknowledgement (ACK).
  * Sent from the target to the host.
* 33-bits - A Payload.
  * 32-bits for data, and 1-bit for parity.
  * This may be host to target in the case of a write.
  * This may be target to host in the case of a read.

All together, a request will be 46 clock cycles long - with one bit per clock
cycle.

Those with a keen eye will note that there are only 44-bits accounted for in
the list above, rather than 46. This is due to 2-bits being used for the two
'turn round' sequences required to transfer control of the `SWDIO` line
between the host and target.

These 'turn round' sequences would be inserted in slightly different places
depending on whether this was a read or write request:

  * Read
    * One 'turn round' would be inserted after the request header is written.
    * One 'turn round' would be inserted after the payload is written.
  * Write
    * One 'turn round' would be inserted after the request header is written.
    * One 'turn round' would be inserted after the ACK is written.

As to its purpose, this sequence is needed to transfer control of the `SWDIO`
line between host and target. This is required due to `SWDIO` being driven
by either host or target; this sequence is used as a sort of 'give way'
signal to avoid both host and target attempting to write to `SWDIO`
simultaneously (which would cause contention).

One caveat to note here is that in the case of a request failure, the payload
may be omitted and only the ACK returned.

#### Request Header

The request header has a very simple and fixed format. It is 8-bits long, and
instructs the target whether the request is to read or write, intended for an
AP or DP, and the address of the target register.

The format of a request packet header is as follows - per section 4.3 of
[ARM IHI 0031C](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf):

![](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-Request-Header.png){: .center-image }

* `START`
  * This should always be high (`0b1`).
* `APnDP`
  * high (`0b1`) for access to AP access, low (`0b0`) for DP access.
* `RnW`
  * high (`0b1`) for READ access, low (`0b0`) for WRITE access.
* `ADDR[2:3]`
  * Two bits representing the register to access.
  * This address is once again written to `SWDIO` LSB first!
* `PARITY`
  * In the case of a request packet, this field is high (`0b1`) if the number
    of high (`0b1`) bits in the `APnDP`, `RnW`, and `ADDR` fields combined is
    odd. low (`0b0`) if an even.
* `STOP`
  * This should always be low (`0b0`).
* `PARK`
  * This should always be high (`0b1`).

Consider the following examples:

![0b10100101](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-0b10100101.png){: .center-image }

This above would indicate a `READ` request of the `DP` `IDR` register (`0b00`).

![0b10001101](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-0b10001101.png){: .center-image }

This would indicate a `WRITE` request of the `DP` `SELECT` register (`0b10`).
Once again, the `ADDR` of the `SELECT` register is LSB first, so `0b10` becomes
`0b01` on the wire.

#### Acknowledgement (ACK)

The format of an ACK is as follows - per section 4.3 of
[ARM IHI 0031C](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf):

![ACK](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-ACK.png){: .center-image }

The mapping of valid responses of an ACK are as follows:

* `OK` (`0b001`)
  * "Everything's fine."
  * This will appear on the wire LSB first (`0b100`).
* `WAIT` (`0b010`)
  * "Try again in a bit, I'm still busy."
  * This will appear on the wire LSB first (`0b010`).
* `FAULT` (`0b100`)
  * "Something went wrong."
  * This will appear on the wire LSB first (`0b001`).

One caveat for the `FAULT` response is that when a DP has responded with this
result, the DP will only then reply to:

  * `READ` of the `DP` `IDP` register.
    * Used to identify the device.
  * `READ` of the `DP` `CTRL/STAT` register.
    * Used to read the status bits which may indicate cause of failure.
  * `WRITE` of the `DP` `ABORT` register.
    * Used to reset status bits, clearing the fault.

#### Payload

The logical mapping inside of the payload will differ depending on the type of
request, however, both read and write payloads look the same on the wire from
a conceptual standpoint. This format is as follows - per section 4.3 of [ARM IHI 0031C](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf):

![Payload](/assets/article_images/2018/SWD-Request-Payload.png){: .center-image }

`RDATA` and `WDATA` in this diagram simply refers to read or write data,
respectively. This is only being used to demonstrate that this payload is
the same for both read and write operations, from here, both will just be
referred to as `DATA`.

Finally, the parity calculation used to populate the parity bit is performed
in the same way as the request header. If the number of bits in the `DATA`
field that are high (`0b1`) is odd, this parity bit will be high (`0b1`). If
even, the parity bit will be low (`0b0`).

## FIN.

...Phew! Okay, that's enough overview for now. Although this post has been
very dry, it should make the next much easier. The next post should contain
information related to interacting with SWD via an FT2232H via Python, and
how to 'map' the DAP from SWD.

Hopefully I'll have some PoC code ready to go, too!
